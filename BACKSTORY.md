## How It Began

A long time ago (*around 2013*), [I created a project (*called “**JFDI**”*) to manage my goals and action items][jfdi] — [I even wrote a manifesto about it][jfdi-manifesto].

The reason I created *JFDI* was that I thought that an offline *command line* app that you can run from the comfort of your terminal was much faster, efficient, and effective. — Those shiny/bloated GTD apps with pretty user interfaces were just an overkill, even a **friction** in actually getting things done. 

For a while, it was good. — *JFDI* became “**the**” command line application that I used to manage my goals. The simple interface that it provided, and its speed and portability was doing wonders for my productivity. — And I still think [**JFDI as a methodology**][jfdi-manifesto] is the most **efficient** way of getting things done, regardless of which app you use to implement it.

Though, after using *JFDI* for a few years, it hit me: If there was one single application that was open all the time on my computer, it was **my browser**!

> I was in a delusion that the command-line terminal is all that I need, while the epicenter of my life was my browser.

Also, in time, synchronizing my goals **to the cloud**, and accessing them **in real time** became more and more necessary. — As an offline, desktop app; *JFDI* was not capable of that. — Yes, I could integrate it with a cloud REST-ful database, but that was not my only issue with *JFDI*. 
 
My other problem was the user interface (*or the lack, thereof*). See, clicking a “clone this goal” button turned is much easier than remembering which command-line flag was required to clone a task. 

> After all, if I had [limited mental focus][limited-resources], why waste it on memorizing command-line trivia?

Besides, Internet connectivity **improved** over the last couple of years: Mobile internet connectivity today is much better than five years ago: You can have a decent mobile wifi from almost anywhere you roam. 

So you don’t need an offline-first app as badly as you needed ten years ago. — The irony is: there was no concept of an “offline web app” when you badly needed it back in those days.

And the last but not the least, a browser interface opens a wide variety of options to **interact** with the UI which is simply not possible with a terminal emulator.

> However, with great power also comes great responsibility. In **JediFocus** I’ll continue to maintain the same minimalistic philosophy keep the interface **fast**, **simple**, and **usable**.
> 
> That might, at times, mean that I will be **intentionally** making the app **less** flexible, or I will be **hiding** things that the user doesn’t have to see immediately. — Less is **more**.

## Doesn’t Trello/Asana/OmniFocus/etc… Do the Same Thing?

There are other “getting things done” web applications around that you can use 

I tried almost all of them; however, they did not serve what I needed: They were either too bloated, or too simplistic, or too different.

So, I decided to scratch my own itch (*once more, after JFDI*); and created **JediFocus**.

The issue with task management is: It so personal that it’s virtually impossible to find a universal application that solves everybody’s problems at the same time.

I’m sure some will like **JediFocus**, and some will feel more comfortable using a different app.
 
> Let me tell you a secret: It’s not the app that you use; it’s the focus, discipline, dedication, and repetition that makes you succeed.
