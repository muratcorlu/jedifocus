## What Makes **JediFocus** Different?

Simply, “*simplicity*”:

* **Less** confusion,
* **Less** configuration,
* And **less** clutter.

## Why Doesn’t **JediFocus** Have **X**?

This is the most commonly-asked question, so let’s answer this once and for all:

**Because you don’t need it**!

**JediFocus** won’t let you [die by a thousand micro decisions][limited-resources].

You don’t need labeling, categorization, filtering, searching, color coding to be productive. 

You don’t even need to set reminders and alarms to be productive. 

Those are all illusions that steal the most precious asset of yours: Your time.

> To be productive, you just need to **get $#!% done**. — Don’t sort your jelly beans like a five year old.

**Less** is **more**.

## Productivity Tips

> This section contains useful **productivity** tip to get you “**in the zone**”. 
>
> They are not specific to **JediFocus**.

### GTD is a Big Old Fat Lie!

[*Getting Things Done*](getting-things-done) is a **virtual reality**.

More often than not, when you mean you are “*getting things done*”, instead of doing actual work, you are organizing, categorizing, labeling your list of items. 

Unless you are a librarian, that is **not** getting things done; per contra, that is just “appearing” to be busy.

> Categorizing, or labeling something does not get it done. — **Doing** it gets it **done**.

### Always Clear to Neutral

This is something that you should do **all the time**.

Think of it like hibernating your work.

If you cannot finish your work right now and you need to work on something else, leave it in a state that it will be **effortless** to continue when you want to resume it later.

Note down, what you were doing; what you will do; important things that you need to take care of, and anything else that will help you when you restart your goal later. 

> Freeze your work in a state that you can resume easily, by supporting it with extra hints.

**Think of your future self** before you pause your goal; she will be grateful to you.

### Trust Your Instincts

This is also easily overlooked, and it is really important.

Even you think that you don’t know what to do next, deep do inside you **do** know that you know.

When finishing a goal, deciding what to do next should not take hours. — You should instinctively know the next thing to be done. So decide quickly and be done with it. 

Remember, any action is better than the frustration you’ll get from your “paralysis-by-analysis”.

> You don’t need a Gannt Chart to decide what to do next; you already, inherently know what to do. — **Just freaking do it**!

### Don Not Over-Analyze

**Done is better than perfect**.

> Be like water; always in motion.

Do your best to **always be in motion**.

Do not over-analyze. Stick with what works for now and move on.

### Focus

This one is obvious, but there is no harm restating it:

**Reduce** the number items you will do within a week to a **bare minimum** (*the ideal number is: “one big goal per week”*).

**Eliminate** distractions: turn off Slack, turn off email, turn off notifications, silence your phone, turn off the Internet… (*or use it only for things that will help to get your goal done*).

Check your information channels (such as Slack or email) at a particular time, when you want. — Trust me, your slack alert is not coming from the President, and it can wait.

> You have a limited willpower, and losing your focus kills it by a thousand papercuts.

### Simpler

**Aim for simplicity**, and then make it **even simpler**.

### Do Not Micro-Measure Time

Your smallest time unit should be **a week**; anything smaller than that is too granular to be measured reliably.

How many times have you estimated a task to take “just two hours” and realized it will span half of your week? — See?

Do you think otherwise? Be my guest!

> The time you spend tracking things is the time you can do valuable work instead.

**Don’t track time**; it’s **useless**.

### Have a Routine

Repetition does wonders. 

Religiously stick to your schedule.

Having a routine also helps with learning, retention, and memory. 

### Defaults Are Your Friend

Do not customize things unless it gives you a measurable productivity boost.

* You don’t have to change the music genre you listen to every freaking hour!
* You don’t have to use that cool monotype font that everyone has gone crazy about.
* You don’t have to change your system/IDE/workflow/etc with the new cooler one.

Every software you use, every object you interact with, even every person you talk to has a sane set of defaults; know them, **use them**. 

> In the rare occasion that you need to customize something, make sure that you do it once only once and be done with it.

Related: **Automate** yoir customizations whenever possible.

### The “*Five Minutes*” Rule

Some call this the “two minutes” rule; some call the “fifteen minutes” rule; I’ve never heard anyone call it the “one hour” rule **:)** — Nonetheless, the gist is the same:

> If something comes to your mind, and you can get it done in a small unit of time (*such as five minutes*), then it is not even worth keeping track of it. — Just finish it and be done with it.

It does not matter how important or critical that thing is. It’s just five minutes of your time anyway. And it’s much more effort to book-keep it, revise it and categorize it; so just freaking do it.

### Start From the Top; Move to the Bottom; Don’t Skip

Start from the top, and move all the way down to the bottom.

Do not skip items. Do not rearrange things. Just work on them **in order**.

If the topmost item is not doable right now for any reason, **move it to Backlog**, and proceed to the next item.

### **$#!%** Happens

Rest assured; **$#!%** will happen: Your priorities will shift, or even your motivation can change. 

Feel no guilt in pushing items to **Backlog** or even to **Ice Box** (*see their definitions below*).

### Do It Tomorrow

**Defer and delegate brutally**.

Defer your goals to tomorrow so that you can achieve more important goals today.

### Be Lazily Intelligent; Be Intelligently Lazy

**Be intelligently lazy; or be lazily intelligent**.

My dearest geek friend: You don’t have to learn the entire API.

And you don’t have to learn it **right now**.

Slice your experience into logical chunks, and **defer** as much as you can.

### When a Goal is **Done**; It Is **Gone** 

Don’t focus on what you just did; focus on **what you will do next**.

> When you mark an item as **Done**, **JediFocus** removes it entirely. — So when it is **done**, it is **gone**.

Keeping a track log of done items is a useless mental overload. It is **futile** and **pointless**.

## **JediFocus** User Interface and Concepts

> For a deeper discussion on the topic, see [**JediFocus** Design Guidelines](DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md)

This section describes **JediFocus**’ user interface and user experience.

> **JediFocus** is designed to be **simple** and **intuitive**, so you probably don’t need to read this section as you’ll discover how to use it while you use it.

### Context

In **JediFocus** terminology, **context**s are “**buckets**” that you can put your **goals** in. You can switch between different contexts whenever you like. 

 **JediFocus** has seven pre-defined contexts:

* **Runway**: The things that you are actively working on.
* **Low-Hanging Fruits**: Things that can do relatively quickly, and still get value out of.
* **Errands**: Routines, short tasks, chores. Things that you have to do nonetheless.
* **Backlog**: The items that you are not working on right now. — You will pick up your next goals from here.
* **Clarify / Revisit**: Things here need to be processed further before you can do actual work on them.
* **Later / Maybe**: Things that are not planned for the near future; but you might want to look at every once in a while.
* **Ice Box**: You probably visit these once a year or so. They are frozen, and you don’t consider working on them for a long time, if at all.

> **Tip**
>
> As a best practice, at any given time, there should not be more than two weeks worth of work in your “*Runway*”.
>
> Mercilessly move anything that does not fit in to **backlog**.
>
> If you think something that will take longer than that, then there **always** is a way to **split** it to smaller chunks.

You can move any goal from one context to the other; however, each goal can belong to one and only one context.

By design, **JediFocus** only allows the above-listed contexts; you cannot rename them, change them, or add new contexts.

On a similar note, you cannot define additional columns, or you cannot change the name of a column.

This is one of the **opinionated** design decisions that **JediFocus** has. It was a rather hard, yet necessary, decision to make.
 
### About “Best Intentions”

When you create a new goal, it is inserted into this “Best Intentions” column, by default.

### What is a “Goal”?

Goals are the **cards** that you create by tapping the “*add new*” button.

### About “To Do”

“**To Do**” is the column that you put your goals that you plan to work on soon.

### The “Context” Button

It is the button you use to… well… switch to a different context.

Contexts are “buckets” that you can put your goals in.

When you switch to a context, you only see the cards that belong to that context.

## Your Goals are Sorted Automagically

**JediFocus** goals auto-sort themselves.

The items that you interact with move to top; therefore the items you touch less will automatically bubble down.

This way you don’t have to bother with prioritizing things: 

Since the goals that you are interacting with are, presumably, more important than the goals that you are not batting an eye; your goals will always be quasi-prioritized. 

And that is **good enough**,

Wasting time to precisely sort and prioritize items is a losing battle. — Spend your valuable mental resources in other things than sorting stuff; like… actually **doing** stuff!

## Every Saga Has a Beginning

I’m **obsessed** with **GTD** (*getting things done*), productivity methodologies, and the like. 

I’ve tried almost all productivity tools and techniques that have been around so far, only to see that they all were mere **illusions**. — They are **virtual realities** to make you **feel** productive.

The sole thing you need, to be **actually** productive, is a Jedi-like **focus**. 

The focus that you’ll get by **JediFocus**.

Think of **JediFocus** more like an **approach**, or a “*way of life*”, than a tool.

> When you have **focus**, your **mind** will handle the rest for you.

## Doesn’t Trello/Asana/OmniFocus/etc… Do the Same Thing?

There are other “getting things done” web applications around, of course.

During the past ten years, I’ve tried them all; and they did not serve what I needed: 

They were either too bloated, or too simplistic, or too… different.

So, I decided to scratch my own itch and created **JediFocus**.

> The issue with task management is: It so personal that it’s impossible to find a universal application that solves everybody’s problems at the same time.

I’m sure some will like **JediFocus**, and some will feel more comfortable using a different app.
 
Let me tell you a secret: 

> It’s not the app that you use; it’s the focus, discipline, dedication, perseverance, persistence, routines, and boring **repetition** that makes you succeed.
