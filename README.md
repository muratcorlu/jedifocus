**JediFocus** gives you an a **simple** and **opinionated** way to handle your goals. 

## What Makes **JediFocus** Different?

Simply, “simplicity”.

**JediFocus** is an **opinionated** goal organizer that offers…

* **Less** confusion
* **Less** configuration
* And **less** clutter

**JediFocus** is designed to be **intuitive**, **simple**; but not “*simpler*”:

> **JediFocus** has everything you need, and nothing you don’t; so you don’t [die by a thousand micro decisions][limited-resources].

## A [ByteSized.TV][vidcast] Project

This repository is a part of the [Byte-Sized JavaScript VideoCasts][vidcast].

### Byte-Sized What?!

[Byte-Sized JavaScript][vidcast].

It is a compilation of short (*around ten minutes*) screencasts about **JavaScript** and related technologies.

## Every Saga Has a Beginning

> What I finally relized is “*getting things done*” is a **virtual reality**. 
>
> All you need is a Jedi-like **focus**. — Your mind will handle the rest for you.

I don’t want to bore you with the details here. I’m obsessed with productivity methodologies and from **meditation**, to **pomodoro**, to **GTD**, you name it! — **JediFocus** is here because **none** of the productivity apps on the market satisfied all my needs.

In short when developing and enhancing **JediFocus**, I know what I am doing.

[Read the backstory][BACKSTORY.md], if you want to learn how it all began.
