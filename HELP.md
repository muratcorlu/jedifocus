## Play in The Sandbox First

When **JediFocus** Launches the first time, it displays you a special sandbox context that has informational cards in it.

Spend as much time in the sandbox as you like, until you feel comfortable with the controls.

Playing in the sandbox is not required to learn the app (*since the user interface is simple and intuitive already*); however, by playing in the sandbox you may still catch a quite a few tips and trick that can save you time.

## General Tips

> Goal management can only be successful when you keep things stupidly simple at the highest level.

For instance…

* Your smallest time unit should be **a week**; anything smaller than that means you’ll “appear to be busy” managing your goals, instead of actually **completing** them.
* **Focus** on one major thing every week.
* Related: Deciding what to do “next week” should not take hours. Make a decision, and stick to it. — The worst that can happen is, you’ll work on that thing for one week and then switch to something else. — You don’t need a Gannt Chart to decide what to do next; you already, inherently know what to do. — Just trust your gut.
* Do anything you can quickly do **right now**, no questions asked (*see the “five minutes” rule below*).
* Labels are helpful. — Like `@nextup`, `@current`, `@mvp`, `@urgent`… etc.; however don’t abuse them. Have a handful of labels, and know what they are for.


## The “Five Minutes” Rule

> Some call this the “two minutes” rule; some call the “fifteen minutes” rule; I’ve never heard anyone call it the “one hour” rule **:)** — Nonetheless, the gist is the same.

This is one of the fundamental rules of productivity. — If something comes to your mind, and you can get it done in a small unit of time (*such as five minutes*) then it is not even worth keeping track of it. — Just finish it and be done with it.

It does not matter how important or critical that thing is. It’s just five minutes of your time anyway. And it’s much more effort to book-keep it, revise it and categorise it; so just freaking do it.

If for some reason you cannot do it **right now**, add it to **JediFocus** and move it to a context like **30 minutes** (*see description of contexes below*)

## Don’t Over-Analyze

Do your best to **always be in motion**.

Do not over-analyze anything. Stick with what works for now and move on.

**Done is better than perfect**.

## Don’t Track Your Time

The smallest block of time that you can reliably measure and estimate is **one week**.

Do you think otherwise, then be my guest.

The time you spend tracking things is the time you can do valuable work instead.

If you really do want a plan, make sure your smallest quantum of time is no less than **one week**.

## **$#!%** Happens

**Everything is in motion**. So don’t be rigid in your plans.

Rest assured; **$#!%** will happen: Your priorities will shift, or even your motivation can shift. 

Feel no guilt in pushing items to **Backlog** or even to **Ice Box**.

**Brutally defer and delegate**.

Defer your goals to tomorrow, so you can achieve more important goals today.

**Be intelligently lazy; or be lazily intelligent**.

> My dearest geek friend; you don’t have to learn the entire API.
>
> And you don’t have to learn it **right now**.
>
> Slice your experience into logical chunks, and **defer** as much as you can.

As a rule of thumb, your **Runway** should not include more than you can do in two weeks of time (*see the definition of **Runway** below).

## Start From the Top; Move to the Bottom; Don’t Skip

Start from top, and move all the way down to the bottom. — Do not skip items.

If the topmost item is not doable right now for any reason, **move it to Backlog**, and move on to the next item.

## When a Goal is **Done**; It Is **Gone** 

**Don’t focus on what you just did; focus on what you will do next**.

When you mark an item as **Done**, **JediFocus** removes it entirely. — So when it is **done**, it is **gone**.

Keeping a track-log of done items is a useless mental overload. It is **futile** and **useless**.
