## Play in The Sandbox First

When **JediFocus** Launches the first time, it displays you a unique sandbox context that has informational cards in it.

Spend as much time in the sandbox as you like, until you feel comfortable with the controls.

Playing in the sandbox is not required to learn the app (*since the user interface is **simple** and **intuitive** already*); however, by playing in the sandbox, you may still catch a quite a few tips and trick that can save you time.

## General Tips

> [*Getting Things Done*](getting-things-done) is a **virtual reality**.
>
> Unless you keep things **stupidly simple**, instead of doing actual work, you will find yourself organizing, categorizing, labeling your list of items.
>
> Guess what? Categorizing, or labeling something does not get it done. — **Doing** it gets it **done**.

So **aim for simplicity**, and then make it **even simpler**.

Here are a few tips that will help you follow this guideline.

### Do No Micro-Measure Time

Your smallest time unit should be **a week**; anything smaller than that means you’ll “appear to be busy” managing your goals, instead of **completing** them.

### Focus

This one is obvious, but there is no harm restating it:

* **Reduce** the number items you will do within a week to a **bare minimum** (*the ideal number is: “one big goal per week”*).
* **Eliminate** distractions: turn off Slack, turn off email, turn off notifications, silence your phone, turn off the Internet… (*or use it only for things that will help to get your goal done*). —  Check your information channels (such as Slack or email) at a particular time, when you want; **not** whenever you get a notification.
* **Focus**.

### Always Clear to Neutral

Think of it like hibernating your work.

If you cannot finish your work right now and you need to work on something else, leave it in a state that it will be **effortless** to continue when you want to resume it later.

Note down, what you were doing; what you will do; important things that you need to take care of, and anything else that will help you when you restart your goal later. 

> Freeze your work in a state that you can resume easily, by supporting it with extra hints.

**Think of your future self** before you pause your goal; she will be grateful to you.

### Trust Your Instincts

> You don’t need a Gannt Chart to decide what to do next; you already, inherently know what to do. — Just freaking do it!

When finishing a goal, deciding what to do next should not take hours. — You should instinctively know the next thing to be done.

Even you think that you don’t know what to do next, deep inside you **do** know.

**Don’t be paralyzed by analysis**. 

If you find yourself contemplating on what to do next for more than a minute, just start working on the first thing that comes to your mind. — You will be amazed how productive you will become.

### Defaults Are Your Friend

Do not customize things unless it gives you a measurable productivity boost.

* You don’t have to change your desktop background every week.
* You don’t have to change your code editor’s color scheme every day.
* You don’t have to change the music genre you listen to every hour.

Every software you use, every object you interact with, even every person you talk to have a sane set of defaults. 

**Defaults are your friend**. 

Do not obsess over customization.

> In the rare occasion that you need to customize something, make sure that you do it once only once and be done with it.

Also write down, export, backup any customization you make; so that the next time you need to do it from scratch, it will be done in no time.

### Mnemonics and Labels are Your Friends

Labels are helpful. — Like `@nextup`, `@current`, `@mvp`, `@urgent`… 

As in anything good though, they should be used in moderation.

Don’t abuse your labels. — Have a handful of them, exactly know what they are for; and use them **consistently**

> **Consistency** is the key.

### The “*Five Minutes*” Rule

> Some call this the “two minutes” rule; some call the “fifteen minutes” rule; I’ve never heard anyone call it the “one hour” rule **:)** — Nonetheless, the gist is the same.

The “**five Minutes rule**” is one of the fundamental rules of productivity: 

If something comes to your mind, and you can get it done in a small unit of time (*such as five minutes*), then it is not even worth keeping track of it. — Just finish it and be done with it.

It does not matter how important or critical that thing is. It’s just five minutes of your time anyway. And it’s much more effort to book-keep it, revise it and categorize it; so just freaking do it.

If for some reason you cannot do it **right now**, add it to **JediFocus** and move it to a context like **30 minutes** (*see the descriptions of the various **contexts** below*)

### Don’t Over-Analyze

> Be like water; always in motion.

Do your best to **always be in motion**.

Do not over-analyze anything. Stick with what works for now and move on.

**Done is better than perfect**.

### Don’t Track Your Time

Trust me, the smallest block of time that you can reliably measure and estimate is **one week**.

Do you think otherwise? Be my guest!

> The time you spend tracking things is the time you can do valuable work instead.

If you **do** want a plan, make sure your smallest quantum of time is no less than **one week**.

### **$#!%** Happens

**Everything is in motion**. So don’t be rigid in your plans.

Rest assured; **$#!%** will happen: Your priorities will shift, or even your motivation can change. 

Feel no guilt in pushing items to **Backlog** or even to **Ice Box**.

**Brutally defer and delegate**.

Defer your goals to tomorrow so that you can achieve more important goals today.

**Be intelligently lazy; or be lazily intelligent**.

> My dearest geek friend: You don’t have to learn the entire API.
>
> And you don’t have to learn it **right now**.
>
> Slice your experience into logical chunks, and **defer** as much as you can.

As a rule of thumb, your **Runway** should not include more than you can do in two weeks of time (*see the definition of the **Runway** context below*).

### Start From the Top; Move to the Bottom; Don’t Skip

Start from the top, and move all the way down to the bottom.

Do not skip items. Do not rearrange things. Just work on them **in order**.

If the topmost item is not doable right now for any reason, **move it to Backlog**, and proceed to the next item.

### When a Goal is **Done**; It Is **Gone** 

**Don’t focus on what you just did; focus on what you will do next**.

When you mark an item as **Done**, **JediFocus** removes it entirely. — So when it is **done**, it is **gone**.

Keeping a track log of done items is a useless mental overload. It is **futile** and **pointless**.

## **JediFocus** User Interface and Concepts

This section describes **JediFocus**’ user interface and user experience.

> **JediFocus** is designed to be **simple** and **intuitive**, so you probably don’t need to read this section as you’ll discover how to use it as you use it.
>
> That said, if you want to learn more about **JediFocus**’ user interface, design element, and terminology, then you’ve come to the right place.

Create a single-page help document on the repository; also publish it to a website when the time comes.

### Context

In **JediFocus** terminology, **context**s are “**buckets**” that you can put your **goals** in. You can switch between different contexts whenever you like. 

> **JediFocus** has seven pre-defined contexts:
>
> * **Runway**: The things that you are actively working on.
> * **Low-Hanging Fruits**: Things that can do relatively quickly, and still get value out of.
> * **Errands**: Routines, short tasks, chores. Things that you have to do nonetheless.
> * **Backlog**: The items that you are not working on right now. — You will pick up your next goals from here.
> * **Clarify / Revisit**: Things here need to be processed further before you can do actual work on them.
> * **Later / Maybe**: Things that are not planned for the near future; but you might want to look at every once in a while.
> * **Ice Box**: You probably visit these once a year or so. They are frozen, and you don’t consider working on them for a long time, if at all.

You can move any goal from one context to the other; however, each goal can belong to one and only one context.

To change the context, you use the context switch button at the **bottom right** corner of the **JediFocus**’ window.

Here are some more details about these contexts:

> **Can I Rename a Context?**
>
> **JediFocus** is a **simple** and **opinionated** application to manage your goals. — Any additional feature that complicates **JediFocus** is carefully considered before letting it in.
>
> By design, **JediFocus** only allows the above-listed contexts; you cannot rename them, change them, or add new contexts.
>
> On a similar note, you cannot define additional columns, or you cannot change the name of a column.
>
> This design decision is to encourage you to **focus** on the **flow** instead. — Do not spend your valuable cognitive resources in customization. — Just get going.
>
> Keeping the names of columns and contexts fixed was a hard decision that had to be made.
>
> More often than not, limiting your choices is a good thing, where the alternative is *paralysis by analysis*. 
>
> If you, however, believe an additional context would be useful, [Create an issue][create-issue].
 
#### About “Best Intentions”

When you create a new goal, it is inserted into this “Best Intentions” column, by default.

> **Hint**
> 
> You can tap on the goal’s card to edit it.
>
> You can use [**markdown**](https://github.github.com/gfm/) to style your goal.

##### What is a “Goal”?

If contexts are “**buckets**” that you can put your **goals** in; then what is a “**goal**”?

> Goals are the **cards** that you create by tapping the “*add new goal*” button on the **top left corner** of the **JediFocus**’ window. 

###### **bi** `->` **td** `->` **ip** 

These refer to the “Best Intentions”, “To Do”, “In Progress” columns respectively. You can move a card back and forth between the columns by tapping these items that you can see at the bottom of every card.

#### About “To Do”

“**To Do**” is the column that you put your goals that you plan to work on soon.

> **Tip**
>
> When you start working on a goal, move it from the “**To Do**” column to the “**In Progress**” column; and when you want to park the goal for a while, move it from the “**In Progress**” back to the “**To Do**” column.

**The “Context” Button**

It is the button you see on the **bottom right corner** of the **JediFocus**’ window.

This button is used to switch the active context.

Contexts are “buckets” that you can put your goals in.

When you switch to a context, you only see the cards that belong to that context.

##### About “*In Progress*”

Any goal that you are currently working on goes here.

As a best practice, do not keep too many items “*in progress*”; if there are things that you are not working on for a while, move them back to “*Best Intentions*” or “*To Do*”.

### Contexts

Contexts are “buckets” that you can put your goals in.

You can change your active context by tapping the context button located at the **bottom right corner** of **JediFocus**’ window.

#### The “*Runway*” Context

This is the “**staging area**” where you keep your immediate goals to accomplish.

> **Tip**
>
> As a best practice, at any given time, there should not be more than two weeks worth of work in your “*Runway*”.

#### The “*Backlog*” Context

This is the place that you can pick your next goals.

> **Why?**
>
> The purpose of “*Backlog*” is to make your “*Runway*” **less** overwhelming; so that you can get stuff done instead of being paralyzed by analysis.

While inside the ”*Backlog*” context, you will typically pick a handful of goals and move them to the “*Runway*”.

> **Caveat**
> 
> If you don’t work on a “Runway” goal for more than **two weeks**, it will be automagically pushed to the “*Backlog*”.

#### The “*Low-Hanging Fruits*” Context

As its name implies, this context contains easy items that do not take too much of a mental effort; or anything that you thik can give a quick run for your money.

If you are blocked, or if you want to clear your mind a bit; then you can pick a “*low-hanging fruit*” and get it done.

#### The “*Errands*” Context

These are *non-productive* items that you still have to do anyway like: “Remember the milk”, “Let the dog out”, “Pay the bills”.

#### The “*Clarify / Revisit*” Context

Sometimes you might not be clear about what to do with the goal at hand, or the goal might need to be refined a little, or modified, or split into multiple goals.

Those kinds of goals go to the “*Clarify / Revisit*“ context, to be specified further when you find some time to ponder on them.

#### The “*Later / Maybe*” Context

You are not likely to work on the goals inside the “*Later/Maybe*” context soon; however, you still want to keep an eye on them. — *Just in case*.

#### The “*Ice Box*” Context

The items in the “*Ice Box*” won’t be touched for a long long time. 

They are as good as **deleted**.
